      <description>I just finished my master of engineering program, my focus was on Software engineering &amp;amp; Intelligent Systems. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in building solutions, explore new software engineering techniques, and solve problems. A big part of my program was related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I built few projects using them too.
  I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a place that will allow me to practice and develop the skills that I have acquired so far.</description>
