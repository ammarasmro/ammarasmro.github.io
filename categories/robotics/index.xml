      <description>A pneumatic robotic system that has two movements about two axes, it is used as a take-out robot to carry any object (like a bottle or a jar or anything solid) from one side to the other. Several analysis were carried out to analyze the movements of the robot. The detection of the object can is done by a photo sensor. A strain gauge is installed in the system to detect the weight of the object.</description>
