      <description>A personal assistant that helps with projects
This project started as an idea last summer, I started researching and experimenting around. I have decided to work on it during the last term of my Master of Engineering program as my capstone project.
The biggest inspiration for me was Jarvis from Iron Man, I always wanted to have a Jarvis that can help me with building projects, keep track of the steps, and help me find information.</description>

      <description>The advancements in the deep learning field are happening very quickly, newer and faster models are coming out everyday. Many companies are adopting every new technology that comes out but the adoption of those new technologies can be a bit slower in the educational system. The application and benefits of applying deep learning models and techniques are explored in this project. The significance of this project is in applying new models on domain specific data using a raw text corpus.</description>

      <description>Abstract—Choosing a course at the university is a challenge to students that is overlooked by the system. The student to advisor ratio is big and the student needs to spend months researching a course without finding sufficient data. With so few resources, the student is left with the few lines of description from the course website and the word of mouth, which have such a big risk. Education shouldn’t be relying on risky actions.</description>

      <description>Abstract—The real estate business is a difficult market to understand, but can return very high profits with the right techniques. People spend years in the market to gain the necessary experience to be able to evaluate a property and assess its price based on several factors, those factors have to be extracted from big datasets. This report aims to show an approach to automate that process, the algorithm should extract the important factors and apply them to new data to predict the prices of the new properties without human assistance.</description>
