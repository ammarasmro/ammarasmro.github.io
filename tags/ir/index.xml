      <description>A personal assistant that helps with projects
This project started as an idea last summer, I started researching and experimenting around. I have decided to work on it during the last term of my Master of Engineering program as my capstone project.
The biggest inspiration for me was Jarvis from Iron Man, I always wanted to have a Jarvis that can help me with building projects, keep track of the steps, and help me find information.</description>
